We propose several strategies to further improve statistical power of longitudinal trait analysis, summarized as follows:

| Strategies | Longitudinal mean | WS variability | Longitudinal trand |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
| Rank-based inverse normal transformation | No impact | More powerful | No impact |
| Changeing correlation structure | Sometimes more powerful | Not evaluate | No impact |
| Polygenic score (PGS) adjustment  | More powerful | No impact | No impact |

aaaa
