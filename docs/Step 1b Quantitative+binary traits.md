# Quantitative traits

We can use a linear regression to fit the null model for quantitative traits. Or we can use a linear mixed model to fit the null model and obtain residuals.

## Linear regression





## Linear mixed model






# Binary traits

We can use a logistic regression to fit the null model for binary traits. Or we can use a generalized linear mixed model to fit the null model and obtain residuals.

## Logistic regression
